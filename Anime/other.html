                    <p>The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby:
                        being a
                        hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost
                        all
                        of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is
                        able to
                        defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to
                        an
                        unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite
                        bored.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures
                        called
                        “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant
                        fear of
                        these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these
                        ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.

                        Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken
                        Kaneki, a
                        shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like
                        himself.</p>

                    <p>In 1972, a popular student in Yomiyama North Middle School's class 3-3 named
                        Misaki
                        passed away during the school year. Since then, the town of Yomiyama has been shrouded by a
                        fearful
                        atmosphere, from the dark secrets hidden deep within.

                        Twenty-six years later, 15-year-old Kouichi Sakakibara transfers into class 3-3 of Yomiyama
                        North
                        and soon after discovers that a strange, gloomy mood seems to hang over all the students. He
                        also
                        finds himself drawn to the mysterious, eyepatch-wearing student Mei Misaki; however, the rest of
                        the
                        class and the teachers seem to treat her like she doesn't exist.</p>

                    <p>Saya Otonashi is a seemingly ordinary girl living a mundane life with her
                        adoptive
                        family in Okinawa City. In fact, her only peculiarities are suffering from anemia and being
                        unable
                        to remember any of her life beyond the previous year.

                        However, Saya's forgotten past quickly comes back to haunt her—one night, she is attacked at
                        school
                        by a creature that feeds on human blood. Just when all hope seems lost, a mysterious man named
                        Haji
                        appears and fends off the creature temporarily. But when her rescuer forces her to drink his
                        blood,
                        Saya suddenly enters a trance and slays the monster with ease, using her own blood as a
                        catalyst.</p>

                        Musashino
                        City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the

                        timid
                        character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her
                        anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

                        countryside.
                        Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling
                        his
                        part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture.

                        One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised
                        together as
                        children, they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the
                        kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next
                        Wizard
                        King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is
                        able
                        to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately
                        tries to
                        awaken his powers by training physically.

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>When a shapeshifting demon with a thirst for human flesh, known as "youma,"
                        arrives
                        in Raki's village, a lone woman with silver eyes walks into town with only a sword upon her
                        back.
                        She is a "Claymore," a being manufactured as half-human and half-youma, for the express purpose
                        of
                        exterminating these monsters. After Raki's family is killed, the Claymore saves his life, but he
                        is
                        subsequently banished from his home. With nowhere else to go, Raki finds the Claymore, known as
                        Clare, and decides to follow her on her journeys.

                    <p>Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowel, two friends so close they could be called
                        brothers, receive an abrupt and violent reminder one fateful day of how appallingly merciless
                        the
                        world around them can be. Their whole lives before then were simple and easygoing, consisting
                        largely of local brawls, seducing women, and committing petty theft to make a living and pass
                        the
                        time. What they failed to realize is that in this cruel world, happiness is fleeting, and change
                        is
                        inevitable.
