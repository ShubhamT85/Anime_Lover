                        Himeko

                        class clown.

                        for a
                        short period of time. As this supernatural phenomenon continues to occur randomly amongst the

                        of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray.

                        for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So

                        he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest
                        Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this

                        is particularly infamous.</p>

                        residents turn his life upside down. The decidedly average Sorata finds it difficult to fit in
                        with
                        the bizarre collection of dorm residents like Misaki, an energetic animator; Jin, a playwright
                        playboy; Ryuunosuke, a reclusive programmer; and Chihiro, the dorm manager, art teacher, and
                        party
                        girl.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>Energy-conservative high school student Houtarou Oreki ends up with more than
                        he
                        bargained for when he signs up for the Classics Club at his sister's behest—especially when he
                        realizes how deep-rooted the club's history really is. Begrudgingly, Oreki is dragged into an
                        investigation concerning the 45-year-old mystery that surrounds the club room.

                        Accompanied by his fellow club members, the knowledgeable Satoshi Fukube, the stern but benign
                        Mayaka Ibara, and the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, Oreki must combat deadlines and lack of
                        information
                        with resourcefulness and hidden talent, in order to not only find the truth buried beneath the
                        dust
                        of works created years before them, but of other small side cases as well.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>Tomoya Okazaki is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never
                        amount
                        to anything. Along with his friend Youhei Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high
                        school days away.

                        One day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself.
                        Without
                        warning she exclaims "Anpan!" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He
                        soon
                        discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to
                        motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the
                        encounter
                        off as nothing.</p>

                    &nbsp;
                    <p>Ryuuji Takasu is a gentle high school student with a love for housework; but in
                        contrast to his kind nature, he has an intimidating face that often gets him labeled as a
                        delinquent. On the other hand is Taiga Aisaka, a small, doll-like student, who is anything but a
                        cute and fragile girl. Equipped with a wooden katana and feisty personality, Taiga is known
                        throughout the school as the "Palmtop Tiger."

                        One day, an embarrassing mistake causes the two students to cross paths.</p>
