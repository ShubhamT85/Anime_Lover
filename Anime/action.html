                        <p>Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young
                            brothers
                            Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one
                            forbidden
                            act
                            of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg,
                            Alphonse
                            his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is
                            able
                            to
                            affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they
                            would
                            both
                            eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal
                            limbs
                            called "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.</p>

                        <p>The Amanto, aliens from outer space, have invaded Earth and taken over feudal
                            Japan. As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan
                            are
                            treated with disregard as a consequence.

                            However one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his
                            love of
                            sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his

                            and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course,

                            odd

                            and
                            assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences.</p>

                        &nbsp;
                        <p>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid
                            creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
                            What
                            makes
                            these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger
                            but
                            what
                            appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began
                            living
                            within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                            However,
                            that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly
                            impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating
                            abominations.

                        &nbsp;
                        <p>In the year 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia is establishing itself as a
                            dominant
                            military nation, starting with the conquest of Japan. Renamed to Area 11 after its swift
                            defeat,
                            Japan has seen significant resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to regain
                            independence.

                            Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student, unfortunately finds himself caught in a crossfire
                            between
                            the Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is able to escape, however, thanks to
                            the
                            timely appearance of a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him Geass, the "Power of
                            Kings."
                            Realizing the vast potential of his newfound "power of absolute obedience," Lelouch embarks
                            upon
                            a
                            perilous journey as the masked vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught
                            against
                            Britannia in order to get revenge once and for all.</p>

                            prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the

                            his
                            ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.

                            she can turn him back into a human, but only once regaining her full power.

                            Araragi has hunted down the three vampire hunters that defeated Kiss-shot and retrieved her

                            this powerful immortal vampire, there is no telling what she might do, and there would be no

                        <p>Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had
                            traveled
                            the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be warm and fertile, a
                            place
                            where
                            there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he
                            was
                            born,
                            and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his
                            father
                            once
                            told him, "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt," as he
                            grew,
                            Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.</p>
