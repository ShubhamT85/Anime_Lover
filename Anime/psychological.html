                        minutes before the accident occurs. The detached, 29-year-old manga artist has taken advantage
                        of
                        this powerful yet mysterious phenomenon, which he calls "Revival," to save many lives.

                        However, when he is wrongfully accused of murdering someone close to him, Satoru is sent back to
                        the
                        past once again, but this time to 1988, 18 years in the past.</p>

                        himself a
                        god of matrimony. Meeting this man causes the student to reflect upon his past two years at
                        college—two years bitterly spent trying to break up couples on campus with his only friend Ozu,
                        a
                        ghoulish-looking man seemingly set on making his life as miserable as possible. Resolving to

                        the most out of the rest of his college life, the student attempts to ask out the unsociable but
                        kind-hearted underclassman Akashi, yet fails to follow through, prompting him to regret not
                        living
                        out his college life differently. As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he
                        is
                        hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance
                        to

                    <p>Keiichi Maebara has just moved to the quiet little village of Hinamizawa in the
                        summer of 1983, and quickly becomes inseparable friends with schoolmates Rena Ryuuguu, Mion
                        Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude. However, darkness lurks underneath the seemingly
                        idyllic
                        life they lead.

                        As the village prepares for its annual festival, Keiichi learns about the local legends
                        surrounding
                        it. To his horror, he discovers that there have been several murders and disappearances in the
                        village in the recent years, and that they all seem to be connected to the festival and the
                        village's patron god, Oyashiro.</p>

                    <p>After death, there is no heaven or hell, only a bar that stands between
                        reincarnation and oblivion. There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the
                        recently deceased to a random game in which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or
                        falling into the void will be wagered. Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in
                        between, each person's true nature will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories,
                        dancing to the whims of the bar's master. Welcome to Quindecim, where Decim, arbiter of the
                        afterlife, awaits!</p>

                        stealing hubcaps—that is, until he ends up being tricked by his former co-worker. Unable to
                        suddenly
                        repay his friend's huge debt all by himself, Kaiji is offered a shady deal to participate in an
                        illegal underground gamble on a cruise ship. This turns out to be nothing more than the
                        beginning of
                        his new life of hell—thrown headlong into a life-threatening roller coaster of mind games,
                        cheating,
                        and deceit.</p>
