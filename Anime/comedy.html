                        the

                        close
                        enough to notice his desperate screams for help, and so he sinks into the ocean, where he is
                        left to
                        drown alone. Just as he loses consciousness, however, a mermaid appears and saves his life.

                        That night, Nagasumi is visited by his savior, a girl who introduces herself as Sun Seto—a
                        mermaid
                        from a yakuza family. As it turns out, under mermaid law, a mermaid whose identity is revealed
                        to a
                        human must be punished by execution</p>

                        students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A
                        class,
                        all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the low.

                        Unfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly "great" intellect wasn't quite enough for such
                        a
                        test, and he's now stuck at the bottom of F class.</p>

                    <p>Just the words "I love you," and everything changes—such is the nature of the
                        bittersweet trials of high school romance. Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to
                        confess
                        her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a
                        similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between
                        school,
                        friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the
                        park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight.</p>

                    <p>Chiyo Mihama begins her high school career as one of the strangest students in
                        her
                        freshman class—a tiny, 10-year-old academic prodigy with a fondness for plush dolls and homemade
                        cooking. But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a
                        student's bike to avoid being late, so "strange" is a relative word.

                        There certainly isn't a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei's homeroom class.</p>

                    <p>Takashi Kamiyama is your typical mild-mannered high school student—polite,
                        aloof,
                        and pacifistic, with a slightly above-average IQ. But would your average high school student
                        really
                        enroll himself at the infamous Cromartie High School, known as a breeding ground for the
                        toughest
                        delinquents out there?

                        Apparently so, as that is exactly what Takashi does, though for reasons he'd rather leave
                        unmentioned. However, one thing is for sure: the "hard-boiled rabbit in a den full of hungry
                        lions"
                        is never going to have another dull day.</p>
